## Background
As a part of the Industry Academia community (IAC) activities, many students and freshers participate in an online internship program (IP) every year to become job-ready. This project aims to provide a smart chatbot application using AI technologies to assist these students by answering their queries in real-time.

## Project Overview
The smart chatbot leverages AI technologies to provide seamless and intelligent interactions, enhancing user engagement and automating customer support processes. It integrates with various platforms and messaging services for a comprehensive user experience.

## Hardware Requirements
- Personal computer or mobile phone to test the application.

## Software Requirements
- RASA
- Twilio
- Ngrok
- Python and Python libraries for NLP and ML tasks
- Git
- MySQL

## Constraints
- Cannot use paid services to develop the bot.

## Assumptions
- Users should be aware that the answers are generated by the bot and not assumed as final answers.
- Technical experts should check the bot's efficiency before deploying it into production.

## Functional Requirements
The unified chatbot application built using RASA should:
- Support natural language processing.
- Be compatible with multiple platforms.
- Generate accurate responses.
- Integrate with external APIs for enhanced user interactions, including speech functionality.

## Non-Functional Requirements
The unified chatbot application should:
- Exhibit high availability.
- Maintain low response latency.
- Ensure secure data handling.

## External Interface Requirements
The unified chatbot application should integrate with various messaging platforms, including:
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- SMS
- WhatsApp

## Technology Used
- RASA for natural language processing with custom pipelines and policies.
- Twilio API for messaging integration.
- Python and Python libraries for machine learning and deep learning.

## Getting Started
