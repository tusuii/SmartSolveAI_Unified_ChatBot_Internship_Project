## Background
As a part of the Industry Academia community (IAC) activities, many students and freshers participate in an online internship program (IP) every year to become job-ready. This project aims to provide a smart chatbot application using AI technologies to assist these students by answering their queries in real-time.

## Project Overview
The smart chatbot leverages AI technologies to provide seamless and intelligent interactions, enhancing user engagement and automating customer support processes. It integrates with various platforms and messaging services for a comprehensive user experience.

## Hardware Requirements
- Personal computer or mobile phone to test the application.

## Software Requirements
- RASA
- Twilio
- Ngrok
- Python and Python libraries for NLP and ML tasks
- Git
- MySQL

## Docker

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Docker**: Make sure you have Docker installed. You can download and install Docker from [the official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Docker Compose** (Optional): If your application requires multiple containers or services, Docker Compose can be helpful for managing them together. You can install Docker Compose by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run SmartSolveAI_Unified_ChatBot_Internship_Project using Docker:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-application.git
   cd your-application
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:

   Build a Docker image for your application using the provided `Dockerfile`. Replace `your-app-image` with a suitable name for your image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-app-image .
   ```

   This command will create a Docker image with your application and its dependencies.

3. **Run the Docker Container**:

   Run a Docker container from the image you just built. Replace `your-app-container` with a meaningful container name, and specify any necessary environment variables or ports:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name your-app-container -p 8080:80 your-app-image
   ```

   - `-d`: Run the container in detached mode (in the background).
   - `--name your-app-container`: Assign a name to the container.
   - `-p 8080:80`: Map port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container. Adjust this as needed for your application.

4. **Access Your Application**:

   Once the container is running, you can access your application in a web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` (or the URL and port you specified in step 3).

## Configuration

If your application requires configuration settings (e.g., environment variables, configuration files), you can provide these during the container run command using the `-e` option:

```bash
docker run -d --name your-app-container -p 8080:80 -e YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE=value your-app-image
```

## Docker Compose (Optional)

If your application consists of multiple services or containers, consider using Docker Compose to define and manage the entire application stack. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project directory to define the services and their configurations. Then, you can start your application stack with a single command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Cleanup

To stop and remove the Docker container, use the following commands:

```bash
docker stop your-app-container
docker rm your-app-container
```

To remove the Docker image, use the following command:

```bash
docker rmi your-app-image
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues or errors while running your application in Docker, check the container logs for more information:

  ```bash
  docker logs your-app-container
  ```

- Ensure that your application's dependencies and configuration are correctly set up in the Dockerfile and any environment variables provided during container creation.

## Script Install

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download and install Python from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if it's not already installed.

2. **Pip**: Pip is a package manager for Python. It is usually installed alongside Python. You can check if you have Pip installed by running:

   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

   If not, you can install Pip by following the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run [Your Application Name] using the provided Python script:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-application.git
   cd your-application
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the required Python dependencies using Pip. It's recommended to set up a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment (optional)
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (optional)
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install project dependencies
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   Execute the Python script to install dependency for  ChatBot:

   ```bash
   python setup.py

4. **Run the Chatbot Server**:

   Start the Rasa chatbot server using the following command:

   ```bash
   rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors "*" --debug
   ```

   - `-m models`: Specifies the directory where the trained models are located.
   - `--enable-api`: Enables the Rasa API, allowing you to interact with the chatbot through HTTP requests.
   - `--cors "*"`: Allows CORS from any origin (for development purposes). Be cautious when deploying this in production.
   - `--debug`: Run the server in debug mode for detailed logs (optional).

5. **Access the Chatbot API**:

   You can now interact with the chatbot through the API. By default, the API is available at `http://localhost:5005/webhooks/rest/webhook`. You can use tools like `curl` or Postman to send messages to the chatbot.

## Customization

- **Training Data**: Customize your chatbot's behavior by modifying the training data in the `data/` directory. You can add more intents, stories, and responses to improve the chatbot's capabilities.

- **Configuration**: Adjust the Rasa configuration in the `config.yml` file to fine-tune the chatbot's behavior, NLP pipeline, and more.



## Configuration

If your application requires configuration settings (e.g., environment variables, configuration files), you can typically modify these settings within your Python script or by providing them as command-line arguments.

## Usage

Provide information on how users can interact with or use your application. Include details about available commands, arguments, and options if applicable.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues or errors while running your application, check the error messages displayed in the terminal. These messages often provide valuable information about the problem.

- Make sure you have installed all the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
